## uncode_database_backup

This command is used to manage the backups of the database, with this command you can **create** a backup locally, **restore** a backup and **push** one or more backups to the remote repository.

Currently, the backups are being stored using git, so you'll need to have access to the database backup private repository.

Set up:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/UNCode/db_backup.git
```

or

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:UNCode/db_backup.git
```

Or another private repository you are using for database backups.

**Note:** If you want to set up **automatic backups** take a look at this [documentation](https://github.com/JuezUN/INGInious/wiki/How-to-set-up-backups) on how to automatically do the backup.

Usage:

### Create 

Makes a snapshot of the current database and commits it with the day and time as commit name.

```
cd /path/to/databaseBakup/repo
uncode_database_backup create
```

### Restore
This command has two behaviors

1. Takes whatever backup data you currently have in the HEAD of the repository and restores the database with that data.

    ```
    cd /path/to/databaseBakup/repo
    uncode_database_backup restore
    ```

2. Takes the backup at commit `COMMIT_HASH` and restores the database with that data.

    ```
    cd /path/to/databaseBakup/repo
    uncode_database_backup restore COMMIT_HASH
    ```

    Note: When you run this command, the repository is checked out to `COMMIT_HASH` commit. You might want to get it back to master or the old HEAD after executing it.

### Push
Pushes the non pushed backups (commits) to the remote repository.


```
cd /path/to/databaseBakup/repo
uncode_database_backup push
```

Depending on how you configured the access to the repo you'll may be asked for your username and password to be able to push to remote.

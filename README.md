This repository contains all necessary scripts to automatically deploy UNCode with all of its features.
Here you'll find a step-by-step guide to deploy it in a **CentOS 7** server to be able to host your courses.

For more information, please refer to the project page: <https://juezun.github.io>

## Before you start

Before you start, we recommend that you review the documentation of [proxy settings](proxy.md) and the documentation of [firewall settings](firewall.md). You can avoid problems related to the configuration of this modules by reading and applying the considerations mentioned there.

## Steps to deploy

1. Have a machine with CentOS 7 and git

2. Make sure that there is a password set for root and the user that will execute the scripts

3. Clone the deployment repository

   `git clone https://github.com/JuezUN/Deployment.git`

4. Inside the Deployment folder, make the .sh files runnable

   `chmod +x *.sh`

5. Modify the the environmental variable `UNCODE_DOMAIN` with the correct UNCode domain or IP. To do so, modify the file `env.sh`.

6. Run the command `./setup_environment.sh && source env.sh` to set the environment variables (such as ports used by the different microservices).

7. Disable selinux

   `sudo ./disable_selinux.sh`

   *Running this command will cause the server to restart automatically so that the changes are applied*

8. Install the prerequisites, you can use `./install_prerequisites.sh` to do this. 
   â€‹      
    *Make sure you DON'T run this command with sudo as the user is the one that should be able to use the applications (not sudo)*

   **Note**: Check the *File system docker driver* with `docker info`, this should say `overlay2`. If not, check bellow in common problems to fix this.

9. Logout and log back in to the server so that the user can use mongo and docker without `sudo`.

10. Modify the `configuration.yaml` file to use the setup you want, this is in the folder `config`. In the backend option, set it to `backend: tcp://127.0.0.1:2000`, in the `multilang` plugin options, set the IP or domain corresponding to this machine.
    For more information, see the [Documentation][config_reference].

11. Execute the script `./run.sh`.

### Deploy linter and python tutor

In previous steps, you have deployed the necessary services to run submissions on UNCode, as well as the frontend. However, if you want to install the linter and python tutor services (tools), here there are two options:

- If you want to deploy these tools within the same machine, run the command `./tools_host/deploy_tools.sh` to deploy them. There are not any additional settings to be done.

- If you want to **deploy the tools in a separate machine** from the rest of the application, follow next steps:
    1. In `/etc/nginx/conf.d/inginious.conf` file, change the url to proxy the linter, tutor and cokapi services. Instead of proxy pass to localhost, set the domain name or IP of the server where you are deploying these tools. It should look as follows:

        ```
        location /cokapi {
          proxy_pass http://<IP or damain_name tools machine>/cokapi;
        }
        
        location /linter {
          proxy_pass http://<IP or damain_name tools machine>/linter;
        }
        
        location /tutor {
          proxy_pass http://<IP or damain_name tools machine>/tutor;
        }
        ```
    
    2. Modify the `configuration.yaml` file in `/var/www/INGInious/` in the `multilang` plugin, setting the correct IP of the tools machine. Restart the lighttpd service after saving.
    
    3. Go to [tools host deployment documentation](tools_host/README.md) to deploy these services in another server.

### Add additional grading machines

In case you want to add more machines to grade more submission concurrently, go to [Grading host deployment documentation][grader_host_url] to deploy any number of hosts that will be used as grading machines.

### Deploy metabase

Metabase is a service for data analytics. This is connected to the UNCode's database, that is why you must deploy service within the same machine.

Run the commands:
```bash
chmod +x ./metabase/*.sh
sudo ./metabase/deploy_metabase.sh
```

### Deploy Mongo express

To allow some determined users, a mongo express service is deployed with docker to graphically access to the DB. Deploy this service in the same machine as the Database.

Run the command:

```bash
sudo bash deployment_scripts/deploy_mongo_express.sh
```

## Configuration

### Configuration.yaml

This file specifies which plugins will run when the judge deploys, also is needed that the settings for the SMTP server are set properly (i.e. username and password), if you want to.

### FastCGI.conf

File located in /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/fastcgi.conf, this file specifies the configuration related to fastcgi and the processes that lighttpd will create to handle requests.
The options to focus on are *max-procs* and *min-procs*, these options specify the processes that fastCGI will create. Here we recommend to leave the same value for both options, 
 as this will create an static number of process.

### Nginx

File located in /etc/nginx/conf.d/uncode.conf, this file specifies the reverse proxy rules that are processed by nginx,
Modify the server_name and the IP, as well as other settings you think should be configured.

### Python tutor and linter

Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file, which deploys these services, as you want. You can set different memory limits
 according to your necessities. 

## UNCode scripts

These are some helpful scripts or commands that will help on managing the server. If you want to know more about them please go to [uncode_scripts][uncode_scripts_url] and read the documentation inside it. You will learn how to restart the services, make automatic backups, among others.

## What to do if server reboots?

### Manual reboot
When you reboot the server, you will see that the front end will work fine but if you try  to submit code it won't work. To fix that you just have to follow next few steps:

1. Go into the *Deployment* directory.
2. Run the command `./setup_environment.sh && source env.sh` to set the environment variables (such as proxy and ports used by the backend microservices).
3. If you are deploying the agent in a single machine, run the command `sudo bash deployment_scripts/build_all_containers.sh`
4. Run the command `uncode_webapp_restart`in order to restart all services and make everything work correctly.

You are all set, try submitting code and see if it works.

## Common problems

There are some problems that you might find when deploying the services. 

- Docker compose says that the ports of the micro services are not specified. Solution: Make sure you run the command `source env.sh`
- Docker file system driver should be `overlay2`, to check the config of docker, run `docker info` and the `Storage docker` should say overlay2. In case it is not the case, check the docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/) to change the File system docker driver.
- Mongo DB fails to start after a reboot. There is an unsolved issue with systemd and mongod service that prevents it from starting correctly at boot. Until this issue is solved, the following workaround will start mongodb as INGInious needs.
  `sudo mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf`
- If you copy files into the **tasks** folder, the owner of new files may be different of *ligttpd* so you must change the owner of these files. For that, run the next command recursively on all the files inside **tasks** folder: `sudo chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/www/INGInious/tasks/*`.
